This is a pre-release for people to view the code and progress. It is **not** a complete and ready plugin.

- Event System: For events like Join/Leave Voice Channel, Switch Server, etc (100%)
- Custom Modals: Create modals like the one that appears for Changing Nicknames (5%)
- Custom Settings Panel: Create a settings panel, not like the in-built BD one (20%)
- Custom Context Menu Items: Create context menu items which can also only appear depending on context menu type (0%)
- BD Utility: Utility Functions including logging functions which is recommended to be used over the default *console* (95%)

**Overall Progress:** 30%

The Custom Items allow for developers to create custom modals, setting panels, and context menu items much more simply than having to create a bunch of elements and event handlers themselves.
